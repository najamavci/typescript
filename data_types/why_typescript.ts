TypeScript is a typed superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used.​

*TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript.​The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. TypeScript will
compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax
errors. This helps to highlight errors before the script is run.

TypeScript doesn’t provide any additional runtime libraries. Our programs will use the same standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs.​

Anything you learn about JavaScript is helping you learn TypeScript at the same time​

TypeScript is JavaScript’s runtime with a compile-time type checker.​

TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.​

TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.​

Javascript: ​
let helloWorld = "Hello World";​

Typescript: ​
let helloWorld: string

*The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts the instructions
written in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent
